# The *NeuralSAT* constraint solver for the verification of Deep Neural Networks

NeuralSAT is a technique and prototype tool for verifying DNNs.  It combines ideas from DPLL(T) and CDCL algorithms in SAT/SMT solving with a  abstraction-based theory solver to reason about DNN properties. The tool is under active development and has not released any official versions, though periodically we evaluate the tool on existing standard benchmarks such as ACAS XU and compare the performance of the prototype to other DNN verification tools.
