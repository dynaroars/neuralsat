### TODO

- [x] Try with larger DNN => `Simplex` Issue: Singular Matrix
- [x] Input interface
- [x] Adopt substitution + Optimize constraints in Theory propagate.
- [x] Optimize `Simplex` (copy from scipy library)
- [x] Compare with Reluplex (relation among input dimensions)
- [ ] Finding `Unsat Core` when unsat occurred (Actually don't need that???)
- [ ] Behavior `SAT`/`Unsat` (time consuming)


### Dummy Ideas

- [x] Decide multiple variables in a same layer at once
- [x] Strategy for choosing variables (from low to high id)
- [x] Strategy for assigning variables (randomly True/False)
- [ ] Better strategy for choosing/assigning variables
