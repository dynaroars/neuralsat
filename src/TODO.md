### TODO
- [ ] MILP bound tightening
- [ ] Input splitting for larger input (Can it resolve TO cases of MNIST/CIFAR?)
- [ ] Support Non-ReLU activation (Sigmoid/Tanh/Maxpool) 
- [ ] Support ResNet
- [ ] 
- [ ] 1st UIP (does it really help in case of DNN?)
- [ ] Adopt PicoSAT
- [ ] 


### Dummy Ideas
- [ ] Counterexample-guided search / symbolic execution / under-approximation
- [ ] Fool the verifiers (make verifers run inefficiently)
- [ ] New quick precise abstraction
- [ ] Joint optimize input bounds (not just hidden bounds) with Gradient Descent
- [ ] Quantum Computing
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

### Vu's ideas
- [ ] Show the importance of each part in verifiers
- [ ]
